# Error Handling Implementation Guide

## Implementation Summary

The comprehensive error handling for UID-based recording links has been successfully implemented in the `validateSession` Cloud Function. This ensures all business rules are properly enforced with exact messaging requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Status Classification Logic
- **Added comprehensive post-recording status detection** covering all possible recording states
- **POST_RECORDING_STATUSES array** includes: `completed`, `processing`, `transcribed`, `ReadyForTranscription`, `uploading`, `recording` (plus capitalized variants)
- **Unified error message** for all post-recording states: "This memory has already been recorded"

### 2. Updated Error Messages (Business Rules)
- **Rule A (UID already used)**: "This memory has already been recorded"
- **Rule B (Prompt deleted)**: "This question has been deleted by <<UserId>> and is no longer available to record"
- **Rule C (>365 days old)**: "This link is over 365 days old and can no longer be accessed"
- **Rule D (UID doesn't exist)**: "This recording link is invalid or no longer exists"

### 3. Enhanced Deletion Tracking
- **Added support for `deletedBy` field** to track who deleted a prompt
- **Fallback to "the account owner"** when specific user information is not available
- **Improved logging** for deletion events

## File Changes

### `functions/src/sessions/validateSession.ts`
- **Lines 6-11**: Added business rules documentation
- **Lines 76**: Updated "session not found" message
- **Lines 93**: Updated expired session message 
- **Lines 98-101**: Added comprehensive post-recording status array
- **Lines 104-114**: Enhanced status checking logic
- **Lines 127-138**: Improved prompt deletion handling with user attribution

## Testing Implementation

### 1. Deploy the Updated Function
```bash
cd UIAPP/functions
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions:validateSession
```

### 2. Test with Firebase Emulator (Recommended)
```bash
# Start emulators
npm run emulators

# The function will be available at:
# http://localhost:5001/love-retold-webapp/us-central1/validateSession
```

### 3. Create Test Session Documents

Add these test documents to the `recordingSessions` collection in Firebase Emulator UI (http://localhost:4000):

#### Test Case A (Memory Already Recorded)
```json
{
  "sessionId": "test-completed-user1-story1-1700000000",
  "status": "completed",
  "promptText": "Tell me about your wedding day",
  "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "userId": "testuser1",
  "storytellerId": "teststoryteller1"
}
```

#### Test Case A2 (Upload In Progress)
```json
{
  "sessionId": "test-uploading-user2-story2-1700000001", 
  "status": "uploading",
  "promptText": "What was your first dance song?",
  "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "userId": "testuser2",
  "storytellerId": "teststoryteller2"
}
```

#### Test Case B (Prompt Deleted)
```json
{
  "sessionId": "test-deleted-user3-story3-1700000002",
  "status": "pending",
  "promptText": "",
  "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "userId": "testuser3", 
  "storytellerId": "teststoryteller3",
  "deletedBy": "john@example.com"
}
```

#### Test Case C (Expired Link)
```json
{
  "sessionId": "test-expired-user4-story4-1600000000",
  "status": "pending",
  "promptText": "Describe your honeymoon",
  "expiresAt": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "userId": "testuser4",
  "storytellerId": "teststoryteller4"
}
```

### 4. Test URLs

Visit these URLs in your browser (with emulator running):
```
http://localhost:3000/test-completed-user1-story1-1700000000
http://localhost:3000/test-uploading-user2-story2-1700000001  
http://localhost:3000/test-deleted-user3-story3-1700000002
http://localhost:3000/test-expired-user4-story4-1600000000
http://localhost:3000/nonexistent-session-id-12345
```

### 5. Expected Results

| Test Case | Expected Error Message |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Completed | "This memory has already been recorded" |
| Uploading | "This memory has already been recorded" |
| Deleted | "This question has been deleted by john@example.com and is no longer available to record" |
| Expired | "This link is over 365 days old and can no longer be accessed" |
| Not Found | "This recording link is invalid or no longer exists" |

## Deployment to Production

### 1. Test First in Emulator
```bash
npm run emulators
# Run all test cases above
```

### 2. Deploy Function Only
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:validateSession
```

### 3. Verify Production
Test with a known valid session URL to ensure deployment success.

## Monitoring & Validation

### 1. Check Function Logs
```bash
firebase functions:log --only validateSession
```

### 2. Monitor Error Patterns
Look for these log entries to confirm proper business rule enforcement:
- "Session already recorded" (Rule A)
- "Session has no prompt text - treating as deleted" (Rule B)  
- "Session expired" (Rule C)
- "Session not found" (Rule D)

### 3. Frontend Integration
The frontend `SessionValidator.jsx` component will automatically display these error messages in the error state UI (lines 178-204).

## Security Considerations

### Firestore Rules Compliance
- ✅ Anonymous users can only read sessions 
- ✅ Cannot modify core session fields (`userId`, `promptId`, `storytellerId`)
- ✅ Status transitions are validated
- ✅ All validation occurs server-side in Cloud Function

### Storage Rules Compliance  
- ✅ Anonymous uploads restricted to valid session paths
- ✅ File type and size validation enforced
- ✅ Session existence verified before upload permission

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### 1. Enhanced User Attribution
If Love Retold main app adds `deletedBy` field when deleting prompts:
```typescript
// In main app when deleting prompt:
await sessionRef.update({
  promptText: '',
  deletedBy: currentUser.email, // or currentUser.displayName
  deletedAt: serverTimestamp()
});
```

### 2. Audit Logging
Add comprehensive audit logging for all validation failures to track usage patterns and potential security issues.

## Troubleshooting

### Function Not Updating
- Ensure build completes: `npm run build`
- Check deployment logs: `firebase deploy --only functions:validateSession --debug`
- Verify region matches: `us-central1`

### Error Messages Not Appearing
- Check browser network tab for function call responses
- Verify SessionValidator.jsx is handling error states properly
- Check console for JavaScript errors

### Test Data Issues
- Ensure Firestore emulator is running on port 8080
- Use proper Timestamp format for `expiresAt` field
- Verify collection name is exactly `recordingSessions`

## Support

For implementation questions or issues:
1. Check Firebase Function logs for detailed error information
2. Verify Firestore rules are not blocking operations
3. Test individual business rules with isolated test cases
4. Contact development team with specific error codes and session IDs
