# Migration Plan - UIAPP Firebase Consolidation
# From MVPAPP Reference to Standalone UIAPP

**Version:** 1.0 (Consolidated)  
**Date:** January 19, 2025  
**Status:** C10 Deployed, C11 Pending  
**Result:** ✅ Production Deployment Successful

---

## 1. Migration Overview

### 1.1 Objective
Consolidate MVPAPP's Firebase backend into UIAPP to create a fully standalone recording application, enabling safe deletion of MVPAPP.

### 1.2 Approach
- **Copy & Rewrite**: Used MVPAPP as reference, rewrote for UIAPP patterns
- **Progressive Build**: Each slice (C00-C10) added complete functionality
- **Validation-Driven**: Every component tested before proceeding
- **Zero UX Regression**: Pixel-perfect UI preservation

### 1.3 Final Status
```
✅ C00-C09: Implementation Complete
✅ C10: Production Deployment (https://record-loveretold-app.web.app)
⏳ C11: MVPAPP Deletion Verification (Pending)
```

## 2. Key Decisions Log

### 2.1 Architecture Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-01-18 | Use VITE_* env vars | UIAPP uses Vite, not CRA | All env vars prefixed VITE_ |
| 2025-01-18 | Modular service architecture | Better testing & maintenance | Services split into firebase/ directory |
| 2025-01-18 | Keep localStorage fallback | Resilience & offline support | Dual-mode operation |
| 2025-01-19 | Chunked upload strategy | Memory efficiency | 10MB chunks, 500MB total |
| 2025-01-19 | Anonymous auth only | Zero friction | No user accounts needed |
| 2025-01-19 | Central error handler | Consistent error management | firebaseErrorHandler.js with retry |

### 2.2 Implementation Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-01-18 | Granular function deployment | Avoid shared project conflicts | Deploy functions individually |
| 2025-01-19 | 3x retry with backoff | Network resilience | 1s, 2s, 4s delays |
| 2025-01-19 | React Error Boundary | Prevent app crashes | Graceful error recovery |
| 2025-01-19 | 30-second recording limit | Mobile memory constraints | Consistent across devices |
| 2025-01-19 | Firebase → localStorage fallback | Zero data loss | Automatic failover |

## 5. Troubleshooting Guide

### 5.1 Common Issues & Solutions

#### Firebase Auth Fails
**Symptom**: "Failed to authenticate" error  
**Check**: 
1. Firebase config in .env.local
2. Anonymous auth enabled in Firebase Console
3. Network connectivity

**Fix**: Falls back to localStorage automatically

#### Upload Failures
**Symptom**: Upload progress stuck  
**Check**:
1. Storage rules allow anonymous uploads
2. File size <500MB total
3. Network stability

**Fix**: Retry button in UI, automatic 3x retry

#### Session Validation Timeout
**Symptom**: "Session validation failed"  
**Check**:
1. SESSION_ID in URL valid
2. validateRecordingSession function deployed
3. 4-second timeout not exceeded

**Fix**: Refresh page, check session hasn't expired

#### Bundle Size Issues
**Symptom**: Slow load times  
**Check**:
```bash
npm run analyze  # Check bundle composition
```
**Fix**: Code splitting, lazy loading

### 5.2 Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Firebase deployment status
firebase projects:list
firebase functions:list
firebase hosting:sites:list

# Test locally with emulators
npm run emulators
npm start

# Check production logs
firebase functions:log --only validateRecordingSession

# Verify rules deployment
firebase firestore:rules:get
firebase storage:rules:get
```

### 5.3 Rollback Procedures

#### Function Rollback
```bash
# List function versions
gcloud functions list --project=loveretold-testproject

# Rollback to previous version
firebase functions:delete validateRecordingSession
# Redeploy previous version from git tag
```

#### Hosting Rollback
```bash
# List hosting versions
firebase hosting:versions:list

# Rollback to previous
firebase hosting:rollback
```

#### Rules Rollback
```bash
# Keep previous rules files
git checkout HEAD~1 firestore.rules storage.rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules
```
