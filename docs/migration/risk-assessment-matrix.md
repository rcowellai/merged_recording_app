---

### **🟠 High Risks** (Score: 10-16)

#### **R1: Shared Firebase Project Conflicts**
- **Risk**: Accidental deletion of Love Retold main app functions during deployment
- **Impact**: 5 (Critical) - Would break production Love Retold platform
- **Probability**: 3 (Medium) - Moderate risk with shared project
- **Score**: **15** 🟠
- **Root Cause**: Firebase deploy commands can delete functions not in local directory

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Use specific function deployment: `firebase deploy --only functions:functionName`
- ✅ NEVER use `firebase deploy --only functions` without specific names
- ✅ Test all deployments with emulators first
- ✅ Coordinate with Love Retold team before any rule changes
- ✅ Follow MVPAPP/CLAUDE.md safety protocols religiously

**Monitoring**:
- Always run `firebase functions:list` before deployment
- Verify function names before deployment commands
- Use emulator testing for all function changes

### **🟡 Medium Risks** (Score: 5-9)

#### **R2: Environment Variable Migration Errors**
- **Risk**: VITE_ to REACT_APP_ prefix conversion mistakes cause Firebase initialization failures
- **Impact**: 3 (Medium) - App won't initialize, development blocked
- **Probability**: 2 (Low) - Comprehensive mapping already created
- **Score**: **6** 🟡

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Complete environment variable mapping documented
- ✅ Automated validation in Firebase config initialization
- ✅ Test environment loading before service initialization
- ✅ Keep MVPAPP .env files as reference during migration

#### **R3: Firebase Rules Synchronization Issues**
- **Risk**: Rules deployed out of sync with Love Retold main app requirements
- **Impact**: 4 (High) - Could break Love Retold platform functionality
- **Probability**: 2 (Low) - Rules analysis shows UIAPP compatibility
- **Score**: **8** 🟡

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Rules analysis confirms UIAPP compatibility
- ✅ No rule changes required for UIAPP operation
- ✅ Copy rules directly from MVPAPP without modifications
- ✅ Coordinate with Love Retold team if any changes become necessary

#### **R4: Dependencies Compatibility Issues**
- **Risk**: Firebase SDK conflicts with existing UIAPP dependencies
- **Impact**: 3 (Medium) - Build failures, development blocked
- **Probability**: 1 (Very Low) - Comprehensive compatibility analysis completed
- **Score**: **3** 🟡

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Full dependency analysis confirms no conflicts
- ✅ MVPAPP proves this combination works in production
- ✅ Use exact Firebase SDK versions from MVPAPP (v10.4.0)
- ✅ Test build after each dependency addition

#### **R5: Service Integration Complexity**
- **Risk**: UIAPP service patterns incompatible with Firebase service implementations
- **Impact**: 3 (Medium) - Requires service refactoring
- **Probability**: 2 (Low) - UIAPP patterns designed for service switching
- **Score**: **6** 🟡

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ UIAPP already has service abstraction pattern (localRecordingService.js)
- ✅ Firebase services will follow same interface patterns
- ✅ Implement fallback to localStorage on Firebase failures
- ✅ Preserve existing UI behavior exactly

### **🟢 Low Risks** (Score: 1-4)

#### **R6: Build System Integration**
- **Risk**: CRA build system incompatible with Firebase deployment
- **Impact**: 2 (Low) - Build configuration adjustments needed
- **Probability**: 1 (Very Low) - CRA 5 proven compatible with Firebase
- **Score**: **2** 🟢

**Mitigation**: 
- Firebase hosting supports CRA `build/` directory out of box
- Only change needed: update firebase.json public directory

#### **R7: Development Environment Issues**  
- **Risk**: Firebase emulators don't work properly in development environment
- **Impact**: 2 (Low) - Local development less convenient
- **Probability**: 1 (Very Low) - Firebase CLI and emulators verified working
- **Score**: **2** 🟢

**Mitigation**:
- Emulator suite tested and confirmed working
- Fallback to Firebase project for development if needed

#### **R8: Performance Impact**
- **Risk**: Firebase SDK significantly increases bundle size or runtime performance
- **Impact**: 2 (Low) - User experience affected
- **Probability**: 1 (Very Low) - Firebase SDK is optimized and tree-shakeable
- **Score**: **2** 🟢

**Mitigation**:
- Expected bundle increase ~105KB gzipped (acceptable)
- Tree-shaking removes unused Firebase modules
- MVPAPP demonstrates acceptable performance

#### **R9: Authentication Flow Issues**
- **Risk**: Anonymous authentication doesn't work properly in UIAPP context
- **Impact**: 3 (Medium) - Recording workflow blocked
- **Probability**: 1 (Very Low) - MVPAPP proves this pattern works
