# UIAPP ↔ MVPAPP True Consolidation Migration

## 1. Title & Purpose

**Migration Goal**: Consolidate MVPAPP's Firebase backend infrastructure into UIAPP to create a fully standalone application with complete Firebase functionality, enabling MVPAPP deletion upon completion.

**Approach**: Copy and rewrite MVPAPP's Firebase infrastructure and services into UIAPP following UIAPP conventions, building a self-contained app that preserves pixel-perfect UI/UX.

**Strategic Foundation**: This document provides actionable execution steps based on the [Comprehensive Merger Plan](../COMPREHENSIVE_MERGER_PLAN.md) architectural analysis, modified for true consolidation rather than integration.

## 2. How to Use This Document

### 📚 Pre-Flight Artifacts (C00 Completed)
Before starting any slice, review these essential documents created during C00:
- [`docs/migration/env-mapping.md`](../migration/env-mapping.md) - VITE_ → REACT_APP_ variable conversion reference
- [`docs/migration/firebase-config-analysis.md`](../migration/firebase-config-analysis.md) - Firebase configuration requirements and adaptations
- [`docs/migration/dependency-compatibility-report.md`](../migration/dependency-compatibility-report.md) - Package.json updates needed
- [`docs/migration/risk-assessment-matrix.md`](../migration/risk-assessment-matrix.md) - **CRITICAL**: Deployment safety protocols
- [`docs/migration/rollback-procedures.md`](../migration/rollback-procedures.md) - Recovery procedures for each slice
- [`docs/migration/dev-environment-checklist.md`](../migration/dev-environment-checklist.md) - Validated tool requirements

### True Consolidation Rules
- **Copy & Rewrite**: Use MVPAPP as reference material, copy/rewrite into UIAPP structure
- **UIAPP-Centric**: All development, testing, and deployment happens in UIAPP
- **Standalone Goal**: Build UIAPP as fully functional app independent of MVPAPP
- **Progressive Build-up**: Each slice adds complete functionality before proceeding
- **Validation-Driven**: Every piece must work in UIAPP before moving forward

### Progress Tracking
- Update Status Board when starting/completing slices
- Log all work in Work Log (append-only, never edit previous entries)
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages referencing source MVPAPP files
- Tag completion of each functional area clearly

### Logging Conventions
```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | @developer | SliceX | [STARTED|PROGRESS|COMPLETED|BLOCKED] | commit/PR | MVPAPP source → UIAPP target | notes
```

## 5. Assumptions & Non-Goals

### Assumptions
- **MVPAPP as Reference Only**: MVPAPP is never modified, only used for copying/reference
- **Same Firebase Project**: Use existing Love Retold Firebase project for immediate compatibility
- **UIAPP Build Stability**: Current UIAPP builds and runs successfully
- **Firebase Project Access**: Developers have appropriate Firebase project permissions
- **No User Migration**: No existing users to migrate, pre-launch environment

### Non-Goals
- **No MVPAPP Modifications**: MVPAPP remains untouched during migration
- **No Adapter Patterns**: Direct Firebase integration rather than adapters
- **No Dual Maintenance**: Only UIAPP will be maintained post-migration
- **No UX Changes**: UIAPP interface remains pixel-perfect
- **No Phased User Rollout**: Full consolidation before user exposure

### End State Goals
- **Fully Standalone UIAPP**: Complete Firebase functionality within UIAPP
- **MVPAPP Deletion**: MVPAPP directory can be safely deleted
- **Single App Maintenance**: Only UIAPP requires ongoing development
- **Complete Functionality**: All Love Retold recording workflows in UIAPP

### Service Integration Pattern
- **Direct Integration**: Firebase services written natively in UIAPP patterns
- **Configuration-Driven**: Services can fall back to localStorage via config
- **UI Preservation**: Existing UI components use same service interfaces
- **Standalone Deployment**: UIAPP deploys its own Firebase Functions and rules

## 8. Environment & Secrets
