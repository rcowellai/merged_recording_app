/*
 * App.css
 * -------
 * LEGACY FILE - Maintained for backward compatibility.
 *
 * This file has been split into modular CSS files for better maintainability.
 * All styles are now imported via JavaScript in AppContent.jsx.
 *
 * New modular structure:
 *   - variables.css: CSS custom properties and design tokens
 *   - layout.css: Page structure and responsive grid system
 *   - buttons.css: Button layouts and patterns
 *   - banner.css: Banner system
 *   - overlays.css: Full-screen overlays (countdown, confetti, error)
 *   - components.css: Recording and review components
 *   - focus-overrides.css: Focus state management
 *
 * If you're importing this file, update to import the modular files instead.
